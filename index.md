## 👤 Background

I come from a technical-operational career path developed in environments where:

- Processes matter more than presentations  
- Errors have real-world consequences  
- Solutions must work in practice — not just in theory  

Over time, I integrated data analysis into operational decision-making and formalized my transition by completing an intensive six-month Data Analysis bootcamp (SQL, Python, Tableau).

Today, I am fully committed to building a professional path as a Junior Data Analyst in a data-driven environment.
